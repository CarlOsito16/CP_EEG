**Sunday, 10 OCT 2021**
- Each member searched and presented 2 datasets of their interest to the group
(Poon - Neromarketing, Arousal for producitity, Ball - Motor sensoring and Emotion, Opal - Sleep, Emotions classfication while watching movies)
- After discussion, we agreed on selecting Opal's 'SEED5' that focuses on classifying emotions/ feeling of movies viewers into 5 categories
- To make things more interesting, we plan to integrate the neuromarketing side of whether or not the audience like or dislike the film
- Link to dataset: https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/index.html

Next step:  
- Each of us will find 2 articles related to the selected topic 'SEED5' and will share the brief summary of each article
- Opal will contact the linked site to request data for further work
