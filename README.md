# CP_EEG

**Sunday, 10 OCT 2021**
- Each member searched and presented 2 datasets of their interest to the group
(Poon - Neuromarketing, Arousal for producitity, Ball - Motor sensoring and DEAP Emotion, Opal - Sleep-related EEG, Emotions classfication while watching movies(SEED5))
- After discussion, we agreed on selecting Opal's 'SEED5' that focuses on classifying emotions/ feeling of movies viewers into 5 categories (happy, sad, disgust, fear, neutral)
- To make things more interesting, we plan to integrate the neuromarketing side of whether or not the audience like or dislike the film

- Link to article about the selected dataset: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8337789

Next step:  
- Each of us will find 2 articles related to the selected topic 'SEED5' and will share the brief summary of each article
- Opal will contact the linked site to request data for further work
