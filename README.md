**Sunday, 17 OCT 2021**
- Opal already acquired the SEED-V dataset from BMCI and uploaded all the datasets into github named "SEED5-db"
- Poon read and talked briefly about "EEG-Based BCI Emotion Recognition: A Survey" that tries to explore multiple methodologies that can be utilized from signal acquistion > preprocession > feature extraction > analysis > performance evaluation
- Ball suggested creating the visual Gantt Chart to keep track of the project progress; https://1drv.ms/x/s!Am04WExKvjhatjisHgtbeXgzAhhi?e=0GYhE7
- Article allocation (each select 2 article)

**Sunday, 10 OCT 2021**
- Each member searched and presented 2 datasets of their interest to the group
(Poon - Neuromarketing, Arousal for producitity, Ball - Motor sensoring and DEAP Emotion, Opal - Sleep-related EEG, Emotions classfication while watching movies(SEED5))
- After discussion, we agreed on selecting Opal's 'SEED5' that focuses on classifying emotions/ feeling of movies viewers into 5 categories (happy, sad, disgust, fear, neutral)
- To make things more interesting, we plan to integrate the neuromarketing side of whether or not the audience like or dislike the film

- Link to article about the selected dataset: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/18/5083#framed_div_cited_count

Next step:  
- Each of us will find 2 articles related to the selected topic 'SEED5' and will share the brief summary of each article
- Opal will contact the linked site to request data for further work
